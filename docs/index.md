## About Me

I am a software engineer passionate about Scala, Java, and JavaScript. Additionally, i am deeply interested in Functional Programming and have enjoyed exploring languages like Haskell, OCaml, Idris, Coq, Agda, Isabelle/HOL, Lean4, TLA+, etc.

I am passionate about exploring a broad spectrum of computer science subjects, including algorithms/data structures, system design, concurrent and distributed systems, formal verification, type theory, category theory, abstract algebra, and other advanced theoretical and practical topics. Through self-study and hands-on learning, I continuously seek to expand my knowledge in these areas, as I believe they can significantly enhance my software engineering skills and ability to tackle complex challenges.

Open for meaningful connections and professional networking!
